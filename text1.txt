SCM ( Github for Source Code Management)

Git:
Version Control System is a tool that helps to track change in code

Git is a Version Control System.
It is: 
Popular 
Free & Open Source
Fast & Scalable

We use it for:
1)To track the history
2)To collaborate 


Github:
Website that allows developers to store and manage their code using Git.
https://github.com

Folder is called Repository
Commit - final changes

2 steps:
Add and then Commit


Configuring Git:

git config —global user.name “My Name”

git config —global user.mail “someone@email.com”

git config —list


Clone & Status:

Clone - cloning a repository on our local machine
		git clone <- some link ->

Status - display the state of the code
		git status

Remote - GitHub
Local - Personal Computer/Laptop

cd - Change Directory
ls -a  shows all the hidden files
cd .. - to get out of directory

Whenever we change contents of a file there are 2 process:
1 - Add
2 - Commit



4 Types of Git Status:

Untracked - New files that git doesn’t yet track
Modified - Changed
Staged - file is ready to be committed
Unmodified - unchanged

#When we add changes the file becomes staged
#Then we commit the files to become unchanged


Add & Commit:

Add - adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area.

	git add <- file name->

Commit - It is the record of change
	git commit -m “some message”


Push Command:

Push: upload local repo content to remote repo

	git push origin main


Init Command:

init - used to create a new git repo

	git init
	git remote add origin <- link ->
	git remote -v (to verify remote)
	git branch (to check branch)
	git branch -M main (to rename branch)
	git push origin main


WorkFlow:

Local Git

Make a GitHub repo
Then clone
Make changes
Then add changes
Then commit 
And at last Push


Branch Commands:

git branch  (to check branch)
git branch -M main  (to rename branch)
git checkout <- branch name ->   (to navigate)
git checkout <- new branch name ->  (to create new branch)
git branch -d <- branch name ->  (to delete branch)

git diff - is used to find the difference btw the committed file and the latest change file saved on computer.

git diff --staged -> to compare previous 

How we can delete a file from git repository:

git rm —cached <- name of file ->

git ls-files

file, do not commit repository anduse ls-files command to see the status of repository files.


echo “This is the content inside readme file”>>README.md 
(md means markdown file - to show content in more presentable way)


Challenge:

Open Git bash.
Go to a drive.
Create a new folder named “GitCourse” through Git bash.
Create a new file “README.md” through commands and add Pseudo text in it.

cd D:/
mkdir GitCourse
ls
cd GitCourse
echo “This is the content inside readme file”>>README.md 
ls
git init
cat README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "This is the content to upload README.md file to the local computer repository"
git status
git branch -M main
ssh -keygen -o
cd
cd .ssh
ls -a
